# Interest-Rate-Calculator
A banking institution offers certificates of deposit (CD's) with a variety of interest rates, and maturities of 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. Interest is always compounded - daily, monthly, or quarterly.

Write a Java program that will compute the following information at yearly intervals, for any number of such CD's:  
 
1.	the accumulated value (principal plus interest earned to date)
2.	the interest earned for the year
3.	the total interest earned to date
	Assume that a year always consists of exactly 365 days  

Output will be a series of 10 annual reports:
 
1.	Reports will be in table form with appropriate column headings. There will be one row of the table for each active CD, which will include all the data along with the accumulated value, interest earned for the year, and total interest earned to date.
  
2.	Each report will also print the total accumulated value, total interest earned for the year, and grand total of interest earned to date for all active CD’s.

3.	Once a CD reaches maturity, it will stop earning interest and will not appear in any future reports.  E.g., a CD with a maturity of 5 years will appear in the reports for years one through five, but not thereafter.
